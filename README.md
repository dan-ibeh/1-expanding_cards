# Expanding Cards

This project is the first project in the [50 Projects in 50 days course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. The differences are:

1. I tried to create the cards in the JavaScript file.
2. I used the same image and title. Was to lazy to get other images. :')

## Usage

Simply open the index.html file in your browser.
Clicking on any of the cards expands it and displays its title, reducing the width of the other cards.
